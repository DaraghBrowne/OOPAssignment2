#Concept

My concept was to recreate a simpler version of a tanks game you may have found on your phone growing up. Game is a simple enough 2D shooter in which you kill enemies to gain points. You lose health when you are hit by an enemy, eventually leading to death.

#Home Screen

The home screen shows a pretty cool tank drawing accompanied by some controls.

#Main Screen

After proceeding from the home screen, you are brought to the main screen where all the action is going down. You are thrown into an epic battle between a tank and aliens. The Goal is simple : kill all aliens before they kill you! Killing an enemny yields 10 points. You must gain 250 points to finish a level. You start with 25 health which decreases as you touch enemies.

#Win Screen

if you manage to complete a level, you are brought to the congratulatory screen. You are shown the points you achieved and the amount of bullets you fired.

#Dead screen

Those we were not so lucky were brought to the 'dead' screen. Here they are also shown their score and bullets fired and are given the option the play again.
